This CLI gem will pull information on single engine planes available on the Controller.com website.  When you start the program, you will be shown the first list of 10 planes.  You can choose the corresponding plane number to learn more about that plane or type next and see another 10 planes. Type list at any point and you will go back to the list of planes.
